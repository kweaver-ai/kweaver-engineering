# KWeaver Engineering

AI engineering capability tools and skill packages for KWeaver BKN projects.

## Available Skills

### `bkn-requirement`

`bkn-requirement` is a requirement discovery skill for KWeaver BKN projects. It helps AI engineers and business experts turn interviews, meeting notes, draft PRDs, BRDs, process descriptions, and system/data materials into a business-scenario-centered PRD.

It is designed for the stage before formal BKN modeling.

## Background

In BKN projects, the hardest problem is often not writing the model file. The earlier problem is making the business requirement clear enough:

- What business scenario is being solved?
- Who uses the capability?
- What is the current workflow?
- What inputs and outputs does the user expect?
- What business rules and exception cases matter?
- Which systems, forms, reports, and data sources are involved?
- What permissions, approvals, and audit boundaries are required?
- How should the result be accepted by business users?

`bkn-requirement` focuses on this upstream discovery work. It keeps the main PRD in business language, then produces a concise `BKN_Creator` handoff summary for downstream modeling.

## Service Scenarios

Use `bkn-requirement` when you need to:

- Prepare for a business expert interview.
- Process interview notes or meeting transcripts.
- Convert a rough idea, PRD, BRD, or process document into a standard PRD.
- Split a complex requirement into business scenarios.
- Identify missing business rules, data sources, permissions, and acceptance cases.
- Generate follow-up questions for AI engineers.
- Produce a handoff summary for `BKN_Creator`.

## Relationship With `BKN_Creator`

`bkn-requirement` and `BKN_Creator` work in sequence:

```text
Business idea / interview / draft PRD
  -> bkn-requirement
  -> Business-scenario-centered PRD
  -> BKN_Creator handoff summary
  -> BKN_Creator
  -> BKN modeling, binding, testing, and validation
```

`bkn-requirement` does not create `.bkn` files, bind data views, push networks, or execute platform operations. Those are downstream responsibilities of `BKN_Creator` and related KWeaver engineering tools.

## Installation

### Install for Codex / local agent usage

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kweaver-ai/kweaver-engineering.git
cd kweaver-engineering
```

Copy the skill into your local agent skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cp -R skills/bkn-requirement ~/.agents/skills/
```

Restart your agent session so the skill list refreshes.

### Use directly from a project

You can also keep the skill in a project repository under:

```text
skills/bkn-requirement
```

When the agent has access to the project workspace, invoke it by name:

```text
使用 $bkn-requirement，基于这份访谈纪要输出标准 PRD。
```

## How To Use

### 1. Prepare an interview

Use:

```text
使用 $bkn-requirement，基于 interview-template.md 帮我准备一次业务专家访谈。
```

Main template:

```text
skills/bkn-requirement/assets/interview-template.md
```

### 2. Convert notes into a PRD

Use:

```text
使用 $bkn-requirement，基于这份会议纪要整理业务场景中心 PRD。
```

Expected output:

- Business background and goals
- Business users and responsibilities
- Scenario overview
- Scenario details
- Business rules
- Systems, forms, and data sources
- Permission and approval requirements
- Interface expectations
- Business acceptance cases
- Follow-up questions
- `BKN_Creator` handoff summary

### 3. Review an existing PRD

Use:

```text
使用 $bkn-requirement，评估这份 PRD 是否可以进入 BKN_Creator。
```

The skill will identify missing scenario details, unclear rules, data gaps, acceptance gaps, and handoff risks.

### 4. Handoff to `BKN_Creator`

When the PRD is ready, use:

```text
使用 $bkn-requirement，输出 BKN_Creator 交接摘要。
```

The handoff summary separates:

- `business_confirmed`: business-confirmed scenarios, objects, rules, systems, and acceptance cases.
- `candidate_only`: modeling candidates inferred by the AI engineer.
- `needs_bkn_creator_decision`: modeling decisions left for `BKN_Creator`.
